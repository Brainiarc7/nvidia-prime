  * prime-xconfig:
    - Format the BusID string correctly (LP: #1282796).
      The BusID string created by prime-xconfig had several problems:
      1) It was missing the bus type "PCI", as recommended by
         xorg.conf(5).
      2) Values were written in hexadecimal, as reported by lspci,
         instead of decimal, as expected by the server. (See the
         comment at the top of xf86ParsePciBusString().)
      3) The PCI domain was not specified.
      Giving the BusID string in the wrong format could cause the X
      server to fail to parse the BusID, or to parse numbers in the
      wrong base. On systems with more than one PCI domain, `lspci -n`
      output would include the domain number, which is omitted by
      default on systems with only one PCI domain. nv_get_id()
      expects the bus number to be the first field, which would not be
      correct when `lspci -n` reports the domain, as it does on
      systems with multiple domains.
      Fix these issues by always reporting the domain with `lspci -Dn`
      and using it in the BusID string, prepending "PCI:" to the
      BusID string, and printing all numeric values in decimal.
